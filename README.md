# 🌱 Direct Farm Market

A **web-based Farm-to-Consumer marketplace** that connects farmers directly with consumers, eliminating intermediaries and ensuring fair pricing, transparency, and fresh agricultural produce.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**Direct Farm Market** is a digital platform designed to bridge the gap between farmers and consumers by enabling **direct peer-to-peer agricultural commerce**. Farmers can list and manage their products, while consumers can browse, order, and provide feedback through a simple and user-friendly web interface.

This system reduces middlemen exploitation, improves farmer income, lowers consumer prices, and minimizes post-harvest wastage.
